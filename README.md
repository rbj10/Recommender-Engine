# Recommender-Engine
This recommender engine is build on the basis of movie-to-movie filtering system with addition of movie popularity filter. Because of the RAM availability constraint, I have used relatively small dataset(40k movies). You can download the dataset in the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/download
